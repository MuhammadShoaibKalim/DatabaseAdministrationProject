 <h4> What is a Database? </h4>
A database is a container that stores related data in an organized way. In MySQL, a
database holds one or more tables.

 <h5> Folder Analogy: </h5>

 - A database = a folder
 - A table = a file inside that folder
 - Rows in the table = content inside each file

 <h5> Excel Analogy: </h5> 

 -  A database = an Excel workbook
 -  Each table = a sheet inside the workbook
 -  Each row = a row inside an Excel sheet
